         “A frightful object; a walking spectre, imagined to be seen; generally now used for
         a false terrour to frighten babes”        
         
          (Samuel Johnson, <span class="italicizedText ">Dictionary of the English Language</span>). [<a href="http://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/?page_id=7070&amp;i=299">Digital Edition</a>]
      </p>
      <p><a id="footnote2"></a><a href="#bodynote2">2</a>. The quarto and octavo editions record different archaic spellings of the word “groop,”
         a livestock gutter. 
      </p>
      <p><a id="footnote3"></a><a href="#bodynote3">3</a>. Although, according to the <span class="italicizedText ">Oxford English Dictionary</span>, this form of “landscape” was archaic in the eighteenth-century, it was still in
         use. The <span class="italicizedText ">OED</span> itself quotes mid-century examples from William Shenstone, the poet and landscape
         gardener. Jones may have wished to draw on medieval associations, however, as the
         old-fashioned spellings of “groop” in both editions of the poem suggest.
      </p>
      <p><a id="footnote4"></a><a href="#bodynote4">4</a>. While the capitalization of colors could vary in eighteenth-century typesetting practice,
         the quarto’s capitalized 
         
         “Gold,”        
         
          appearing in the same sentence as uncapitalized green and purple, suggests that gold
         might be metal (a noun) rather than color (an adjective). The matter remains ambiguous,
         however; cf. Jones’s use of 
         
         “Saffron”        
         
          eight lines earlier.
      </p>
      <p><a id="footnote5"></a><a href="#bodynote5">5</a>. The indentation of this line is strange. Normally, an indent would indicate the beginning
         of a new verse paragraph, but the octavo printing fails to include an extra line space—the
         other indicator of verse paragraphs—and the quarto puts this line at the top of a
         page, making a line space impossible.

      <p><a id="footnote7"></a><a href="#bodynote7">7</a>. The oak tree. See <span class="italicizedText ">The Iliad</span>, Book XIV, as rendered by one of Jones’s favorite authors, Alexander Pope: 
         
         “As when the Bolt, red-hissing from above, / Darts on the consecrated Plant of Jove,
         / The Mountain-Oak in flaming Ruin lies, / Black from the Blow, and Smoaks of Sulphur
         rise”        
         
          (481-84). [<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qcMDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Google Books</a>]
      </p>
      <p><a id="footnote8"></a><a href="#bodynote8">8</a>. Jones appears to be overturning Young’s penchant to strike, 
         
         “again, again,”        
         
          the phrase 
         
         “the thought of death”        
         
         : 
         
         “Dost ask Lorenzo, why so warmly prest, / By Repetition hammer’d on thine Ear, / The
         Thought of Death?”        
         
          (<span class="italicizedText ">Night Thoughts</span> V.682-84 in <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/night-thoughts/oclc/19066272&amp;referer=brief_results">Cornford's 1989 edition</a>).

      </p>
      <p><a id="footnote9"></a><a href="#bodynote9">9</a>. Here, one may wonder whether Jones, intentionally or not, is misreading Young. While
         some graveyard poets did wallow in the terror of death, Young’s purpose in <span class="italicizedText ">Night Thoughts</span> is precisely to render death less fearsome.
