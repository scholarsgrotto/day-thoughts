            <br><br><br><hr><br><div class="text-entry"><span class="sectionHeading">A Brief Introduction to <span class="italicizedText">Digital Day Thoughts</span></span><br><br> Henry Jones (1721-1770) started life as a bricklayer in County Louth, Ireland, but in his early twenties, Jones’s literary accomplishments caught the attention
               of the Earl of Chesterfield, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Chesterfield brought this
               
               “natural genius”   
                to London in 1748, where Jones met early encouragement. His poems sold fairly well,
               and his drama, <span class="italicizedText">The Earl of Essex</span>, was, according to the <span class="italicizedText">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, 
               
               “the most popular”        
               
                play dealing with Essex 
               
               “in England and America through the early years of the nineteenth century.”        
               
               <br><br>Financial success and literary recognition in the 1750s would not prove lasting supports,
               however. A retrospective in the May and June 1794 issues of <span class="italicizedText">The European Magazine, and London Review</span> described Jones sliding into 
               
               “dissipation”        
               
                and eventually offending Lord Chesterfield by borrowing eight guineas from the Earl’s
               footman (349, 350). Jones would never recover his patronage. In his last years, Jones
               spent time in sponging houses before meeting with a rather ignominious end: 
               
               “Jones, after being in a state of inebriety for two days, was found run over by a waggon
               on the night of the third, in St. Martin’s Lane, without his hat or his coat”        
               
                (423).<br><br>The success of <span class="italicizedText">The Earl of Essex</span> notwithstanding, Jones has virtually disappeared from literary history. William J.
               Christmas speculates that perhaps 
               
               “no eighteenth-century poet, plebiean or otherwise, who wrote and published as much
               as Jones did has evaporated more completely from our critical discussions of the period”        
               
                (130). Christmas should know: the third chapter of his monograph, <span class="italicizedText">The Lab’ring Muses</span>, is the only extended treatment of Jones in modern criticism (Christmas also wrote
               the current <span class="italicizedText">DNB</span> entry for Jones). If he is mentioned at all, it is usually in passing. The publisher
               Rayner Unwin, for example, discussing 
               
               “uneducated poets”        
               
                of the later eighteenth century, summarized Jones thus: 
               
               “[s]ometimes mediocrity was inherent in the man, as in the case of Henry Jones, who
               was brought from Ireland by the Earl of Chesterfield, quarreled with his patron, failed
               to fulfil himself as a poet, and later had the misfortune to be run over when drunk”        
               
                (77). Aside from <span class="italicizedText">The Lab’ring Muses</span>, the only recent work that considers Jones at any length is Bridget Keegan’s anthology,
               <span class="italicizedText">Eighteenth-Century English Labouring-Class Poets</span> (2003), which reprints selections from several of Jones’s poems, including parts
               of <span class="italicizedText">Day Thoughts</span>.<br><br>Jones deserves further rehabilitation. Chronologically, he stands between early natural
               poets like Stephen Duck (1705-1756), Mary Collier (1688–1762), and Mary Leapor (1722–1746)
               on the one hand, and enduringly-popular laboring poets like Robert Burns (1759-1796)
               and John Clare (1793-1864) on the other. Jones made a ripple in literary history when
               Augustan values began confronting new Romantic sensibilities. Jones’s criticism of
               the graveyard school of poetry in <span class="italicizedText">Day Thoughts</span> is an especially fascinating piece of reader response because the genre is often
               framed as a transitional proto-Romantic, proto-Gothic form. In this light, Jones seems
               rather retrograde—he is concerned that the allure of dark and supernatural imagery
               unfits the mind for mature reasoning and humble daytime pleasures.<br><br>Why he chose poet and Church of England minister, Edward Young, as chief target of
               criticism is a bit mystifying, however. Ostensibly, Jones should favor his work. Though
               Young’s <span class="italicizedText">The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts</span> (1742-1745) is considered an examplar of the graveyard school, it does not dwell
               in the lurid detail which so irked Jones; that was rather the characteristic of poems
               like Robert Blair’s <span class="italicizedText">The Grave</span> (1743). Where Young does dabble in churchyard imagery—
               
               “The Knell, the Shroud, the Mattock, and the Grave; / The deep damp Vault, the Darkness,
               and the Worm”        
               
               —he is quick to subvert it and to turn thought to moral ends: 
               
               “These are the Bugbears of a Winter’s Eve,”        
               
                produced by 
               
               “<span class="italicizedText ">Imagination</span>’s fool, and <span class="italicizedText ">Error</span>’s Wretch”        
               
                (IV:10-11, 12, 14, his emphasis). This is very close to Jones’s judgment against
               
               
               “all this Din, about a Worm’s Concerns”        
               
                as 
               
               “the Vapours of a heated Brain”        
               
                and 
               
               “The sacred Bugbears of a frighted World.”        
               
               <br><br>Indeed, Jones’s cheery portrayal of 
               
               “radiant Gems of Heav’n, that nightly burn,”        
               
                seems remarkably similar to Young’s own positive refiguration of night. 
               
               “Darkness has more divinity for me,”        
               
                writes Young, because 
               
               “It strikes thought inward; it drives back the soul / To settle on herself, our point
               supreme!”        
               
                (V.128-130). Quoting these same lines, Fred Botting writes, 
               
               “<span class="italicizedText">Night Thoughts</span> criticises ignorance and superstition”        
               
                (34). Christmas too notes what should be a congruity between Jones and Young: 
               
               “Jones’s moral didacticism is also concerned with the subject of religion, and he clearly
               champions the cultivation of Christian piety and religious values in a contemporary
               cultural setting. In this respect, Jones closely follows Young, whose nine ‘nights’
               of <span class="italicizedText">Night Thoughts</span> represent a sustained apology for Christian dogma in verse”        
               
                (<span class="italicizedText">The Lab’ring</span> 141). Could Jones have misread Young or lumped him in indiscriminately with more
               grisly graveyard poets?<br><br>Christmas registers these contradictions without offering much explanation: 
               
               “Though Jones apparently lionized Young early in his career, imitating his views on
               ‘Ambition’ for instance, he too comes under fire later in this poem for his ‘horrid
               Scenes’ and ‘ghastly Images.’”        
               
                (154). It is not clear how Young’s restrained use of horrid scenes and ghastly images
               for the sake of transforming them is any different from Jones’s reproduction of the
               same scenes for the sake of criticizing them. Jones’s main problem, Christmas suggests,
               centers on the function of death. Instead of portraying it 
               
               “as the great social leveler, as both Gray and Young”        
               
                had done, Jones views it as 
               
               “only an end to worldly toil, pain, and grief.”        
               
                (154). But here too, the opposition between the poets may not be as great as it seems,
               since Young also portrayed death as a positive good, not just a leveler: 
               
               “Auspicious Æra! Golden Days, begin! / The Thought of Death, shall, like a God, inspire”        
               
                (III.308-9).<br><br>If anything, Young overvalues the spiritual brightness of night and its concomitant
               thoughts of mortality. Young’s narrator aims to convert his atheistic interlocutor,
               Lorenzo, to Christianity by forcing his attention upon the permanent state of death,
               but death as glorious kingdom for the Christian, not as gloomy prison. Even death
               refigured may be thought of to excess, however. Jones asks, should ants and other
               creatures 
               
               “to whom our jealous Pride denies Superior Talents, and immortal Thought”        
               
                be granted the opportunity to 
               
               “rejoice, / With fearless Hearts, of Shadows fearless made, / And fancy’d Terrors all?
               Imaginary / Phantoms! From these exempt, they live at Ease.”        
               
                Humans, meanwhile—a race of 
               
               “Beast and Angel join’d”        
               
               —are scared by 
               
               “Ravens, Vultures, and what Harpies cry,”        
               
                all imaginary thoughts that are the 
               
               “Property of Custom, Fraud, and Cunning!”        
               
                Mankind is too apt to produce visions 
               
               “by Melancholy seen.”        
               
               <br><br>Jones thus seems to assert that lingering in darkness, however positively valued,
               incubates dejection, which is unnatural to immortal man. If he errs in lumping Young
               together with the more lurid graveyard poets, he wouldn’t be the last to overemphasize
               Young’s dolors. Cecil Moore in 1953 judged Young “the gloomiest of all poets in this
               period, if not in all English literature” (232). But another factor may be at work.
               Though Christmas argues that a Christian moral scheme undergirds Jones’s poetics,
               <span class="italicizedText">Day Thoughts</span> hints at a universalist strain in its critique of night thoughts. Jones apostrophizes
               the sun, 
               
               “Was it thy great, thy good Creator’s View, / (O Horrid Plan,) to cheat me into Being,
               / To gratify Revenge and Rage eternal, / In Tortures beyond Thought, and endless Woe.”        
               
                The implicit 
               “no”   
                of Jones’s rhetorical question at the least de-emphasizes terror of sin, death, and
               avenging spirits.<br><br>Through this lens, Young’s attempt at poetic conversion of the infidel through meditation
               on mortality is misguided. The fearsome vision that death presents to an atheist (and,
               for that matter, to the immature Christian), before the reforming eyes of faith can
               refashion it into inspiration, is unnecessary. It might end in depression and superstition.
               Thus, while it does seem a misreading to attribute to Young the whole 
               
               “dismal Pageantry of Death”        
               
                which characterizes other strains of graveyard poetry, Jones’s criticism perhaps
               centers on Young’s apologetics. Jones offers an alternative: to 
               
               “Let Fancy drive these Goblins from her Sight”        
               
                and to look up to sunny skies where 
               
               “Thy Gracious God awaits thee.”        
               
               <br><br>This grace of God is nearly the final thought in <span class="italicizedText">Day Thoughts</span>, but its relationship to God’s law is uncertain. Jones puts the relationship in play
               a few lines earlier when he declares death 
               
               “No grisly Terror to the honest Heart: / If God be just. O Blasphemy, to doubt / His
               Justice or his Mercy!——Mercy all / (But not unjust) is God.”        
               
                Is this a roundabout way of arguing against Calvinist double predestination that
               all humans are eligible for salvation—that they simply need be honest?<a id="bodynote1"></a><a href="#footnote1" style="text-decoration:none;color:#0000ff;"><span class="footNoteLink">1</span></a>  Is it a declaration of universalism screened by a parenthetical qualifier about justice?
               Or is the universal salvation of mankind justice itself?<br><br>Eric Parisot’s argument that graveyard poetry becomes a replacement for the printed
               funeral sermon provides historical context for the thesis that Jones is offering doctrinal,
               rather than strictly poetic or societal, critique. Young and other graveyard poets
               were favorites of the Wesleys, for example, and Parisot documents the religious use
               of Young’s poetry among middle-class readers. Shopkeeper Thomas Turner read <span class="italicizedText">Night Thoughts</span> aloud in its entirety to his family twice in four years, 
               
               “a practice he reserves (according to his diary) for only three other works — Tillotson’s
               <span class="italicizedText">Sermons</span>, Sherlock’s <span class="italicizedText">Practical Discourse Concerning Death</span>, and Milton’s <span class="italicizedText">Paradise Lost</span>”        
               
                (89). Is Jones’s critique of morbid imagery also a critique of this catechetical
               aspect of graveyard poetry? If night thoughts undermine reason and common sense, it
               would certainly be provoking to witness Young being fed to families directly—and not
               just upper-crust literati, but humble tradesmen. Could there also be a class aspect
               to Jones’s criticism? <span class="italicizedText">Day Thoughts</span> raises a host of fascinating questions which demand further analysis and debate.

                  of <span class="italicizedText">Day Thoughts</span>), the audience has to decide how meaning should be negotiated when the texts offer
                  different readings.
               </p>
               <p>Within the main <span class="italicizedText">Digital Day Thoughts</span> interface, the user will find an information text box to the right, and a <span class="technicalTerm">Text Toolbox</span> to the left. The first two radio buttons on the <span class="technicalTerm">Text Toolbox</span> allow the user to switch the displayed base text between the quarto and octavo printings.
                  (If Javascript is enabled in your browser, this toolbox should follow you down the
                  screen as you scroll.) The radio buttons under <span class="technicalTerm">Transformation</span> allow the user to highlight different kinds of change between the two printings.
                  <span class="technicalTerm">All</span> will select every change, both reddening the affected portions of the current base
                  text and placing the non-base text differences into the right margin for comparison.
                  The <span class="technicalTerm">Inflection changes</span> button will narrow the selection to changes in declension or conjugation. The <span class="technicalTerm">Orthographic changes</span> button will focus on spelling, <span class="technicalTerm">Punctuation changes</span> on pointing, and <span class="technicalTerm">Other changes</span> on differences that exceed, or are not adequately expressed by, the other options.
                  These categorizations are not scientific divisions but interpretive decisions that
                  invite critical reflection and critique.

               </p><br><br><span class="sectionHeading">Usability and bug report</span><p>As of the current beta release, there is a bug when trying to find text in the comparative
                  interface using a web browser’s search functionality. The browser may return a no-results-found
                  response for strings of text that are, in fact, present. The error is related to how
                  all modern browsers treat hidden <span class="technicalTerm">&lt;span&gt;</span> tags. At this time, the best work-around is to search the individual quarto and octavo
                  html or plain text files instead (links in the information text box on the right).
               </p>
               <p>As first digital edition and proof of concept for <span class="italicizedText">Scholars’ Grotto</span>, <span class="italicizedText">Digital Day Thoughts</span> will remain in beta stage while the website goes through initial usage testing. Bug
                  fixes, refinements, and potential expansions or contractions of the introduction and
                  apparatus may be made, and some functionality may change before a 1.0 release. Such
                  alterations will be recorded with a simple incrementing number (e.g. <span class="technicalTerm">Beta 2</span>, <span class="technicalTerm">Beta 3</span>, etc). Please note this <span class="technicalTerm">Beta</span> status and number if you wish to cite the edition in current form. The old beta versions,
                  like all versions, will be archived when superseded with updates.

               <p>The web version of <span class="italicizedText">Digital Day Thoughts</span> is built from standard web tools including PHP, HTML 5, CSS, and JQuery. For best
                  display results, use a modern web browser with standard scripting capabilities. <span class="italicizedText">Digital Day Thoughts</span> was originally tested on Internet Explorer 9 and Firefox 31. If your web browser
                  is incapable of displaying javascript, or is configured to block javascript, the comparative
                  interface will not work correctly. Whitelist the website in any script-blocking plugin
                  for full accessibility.
