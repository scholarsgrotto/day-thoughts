#Digital Day Thoughts
====================
This is a repository for *Digital Day Thoughts*, a scholarly edition of Henry Jones's 1754 poem, *The Relief; or, Day Thoughts*, edited by Daniel Johnson. The web version is hosted at http://scholarsgrotto.com/Day%20Thoughts/DayThoughtsIntro.php

Directory structure needs to remain in place for the scripts and CSS to work properly with the .html and .php files, and certain elements like the *Scholars Grotto* header will not display correctly in the .php files. However, provided that you can get PHP to run locally using WAMP, LAMP, or other similar software, the text transformation tools should work.
